Objective:
The purpose of this experiment was to develop a new baseline for determining a sex hormone concentrations of Atlantic stingrays (Hypanus sabinus) throuhout the reproductive cycle, as well as elucidate the effects of temperature on the sex hormone concentrations. 
Structure of Code:
All data is in a csv file, script in Rmd files, and figures in png format.
Steps for reproducing results:
Read in data files, restructure data into longer format, produce linear models for each data set, use lm models to generate anovas to look for significance, and finally generate boxp-lots for each data set.
